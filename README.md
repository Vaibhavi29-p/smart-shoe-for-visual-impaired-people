# Smart Shoe for Visually Impaired People 👟✨

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **smart shoe** designed to assist visually impaired people in detecting obstacles and navigating safely.  
It uses **ultrasonic sensors** and a **microcontroller (Arduino)** to provide **haptic feedback** (vibrations) whenever an obstacle is detected within a certain distance.

## ⚡ Features
- Real-time obstacle detection  
- Vibrating motor feedback for user awareness  
- Compact and low-cost wearable design  
- Arduino-based implementation  

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno / Nano  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Vibrating Motor  
- Battery Pack (9V or Li-ion)  
- Shoe (prototype)  
- Jumper wires & breadboard  

---

## 💻 Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE  
- Embedded C / Arduino Sketch  

---

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.  
2. Upload the Arduino code (`smart_shoe.ino`) to the board using Arduino IDE.  
3. Power the circuit with a battery pack.  
4. Wear the shoe → the motor vibrates when an obstacle is detected.
